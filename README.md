# Portflio

This portfolio website will include projects done for clients (I will have a website to show soon as a case study).
It will also include any significant school projects that I finish since I am focusing my degree on computer programming (AS).
My goal after my AS is to be admitted into a BS program for Applied Artificial Intelligence.

My main languages at the moment are Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C#.

## Beautiful website themes
